                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
                example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using
                images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML
                and its functions.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="So_what_is_HTML,_really?">
            <header>So what is HTML, really?</header>
            <p>
                HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
                HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content
                to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image
                hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, and can make font bigger or smaller, and so on. For
                example, take the following line of content:
            </p>
            <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
            <p>
                If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                paragraph tags:
            </p>
            <code>&#60;p>My cat is very grumpy&#60;/p></code>

            <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>
            <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dash9jjyg/image/upload/v1585810493/anatomy-of-html_gyijdb.png"
                alt="Paragraph element">
            <p>The main parts of our element are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in
                    opening and closing <b>angle brackets</b>. This states where the element begins, or starts to take
                    effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash
                    before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the
                    paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is one of the common beginner errors and can lead to
                    strange results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Elements can also have attributes, which look like this:</p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dash9jjyg/image/upload/v1585810612/grumpy-cat-attribute-small_pfdt1q.png"
                alt="Element attributes">
            <p>
                Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual
                content. Here, <span class="text-background">class</span> is the attribute <i>name</i>, and <span
                    class="text-background">editor-note</span> is the attribute value. The <span
                    class="text-background">class</span> attribute allows you to give the element an identifier that can
                be later used to target the element with style information and other things.
            </p>
            <p>An attribute should always have:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one
                    or more attributes).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The attribute name, followed by an equals sign.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Opening and closing quote marks wrapped around the attribute value.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Nesting elements</h3>
            <p>
                You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called <b>nesting.</b> If we wanted to state
                that our cat is <b>very</b> grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <span
                    class="text-background">&#60;strong></span> element, which means that the word is to be strongly
                emphasized:
            </p>
            <code>
                &#60;p>My cat is &#60;strong>very&#60;/strong> grumpy.&#60;/p>
            </code>
            <p>
                You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested: in the example above we opened
                the <span class="text-background">&#60;p></span> element first, then the <span
                    class="text-background">&#60;strong></span> element, therefore we have to close the <span
                    class="text-background">&#60;strong></span> element first, then the <span
                    class="text-background">&#60;p>.</span> The following is incorrect:
            </p>
            <code class="wrong-code">
                &#60;p>My cat is &#60;strong>very grumpy.&#60;/p>&#60;/strong>
            </code>
            <p>
                The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If
                they overlap like above, then your web browser will try to make a best guess at what you were trying to
                say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!
            </p>

            <h3>Empty elements</h3>
            <p>
                Some elements have no content, and are called <b>empty elements.</b> Take the &#60;img> element we
                already have in our HTML:
            </p>
            <code>
                &#60;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image
            </code>
            <p>
                This contains two attributes, but there is no closing <span class="text-background">&#60;/img></span>
                tag, and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to have an effect on
                it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.
            </p>

            <h3>Anatomy of an HTML document</h3>
            <p>
                That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't very useful on their own. Now
                we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code
                we put into our <span class="text-background">index.html</span> example (which we first met in the
                Dealing with files article):
            </p>
            <code>
                &#60;!DOCTYPE html><br>
                &#60;html><br>
                &nbsp; &#60;head><br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &#60;meta charset="utf-8"><br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &#60;title>My test page&#60;/title><br>
                &nbsp; &#60;/head><br>
                &nbsp; &#60;body><br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &#60;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"><br>
                &nbsp; &#60;/body><br>
                &#60;/html>
            </code>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="text-background">&#60;!DOCTYPE html></span> — the doctype. In the mists of time, when
                    HTML was young (about 1991/2), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML
                    page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other
                    useful things. However, these days no one really cares about them, and they are really just a
                    historical artifact that needs to be included for everything to work right. For now, that's all you
                    need to know.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="text-background">&#60;html>&#60;/html></span> — the <span
                        class="text-background">&#60;html></span> element. This element wraps all the content on the
                    entire page, and is sometimes known as the root element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="text-background">&#60;head>&#60;/head></span> — the <span
                        class="text-background">&#60;head></span> element. This element acts as a container for all the
                    stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's
                    viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search
                    results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="text-background">&#60;body>&#60;/body></span> — the <span
                        class="text-background">&#60;body></span> element. This contains all the content that you want
                    to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable
                    audio tracks, or whatever else.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="text-background">&#60;meta charset="utf-8"></span> — this element sets the character
                    set your document should use to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of
                    human written languages. Essentially it can now handle any textual content you might put on it.
                    There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="text-background">&#60;title>&#60;/title></span> — the <span
                        class="text-background">&#60;title></span> element. This sets the title of your page, which is
                    the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the
                    page when you bookmark/favourite it.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>


        <section class="main-section" id="Images">
            <header>Images</header>
            <p>
                Let's turn our attention to the <span class="text-background">&#60;img></span> element again:
            </p>
            <code>
                &#60;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image
            </code>
            <p>
                As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the
                <span class="text-background">src</span> (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image
                file.<br><br>We have also included an <span class="text-background">alt</span> (alternative) attribute.
                In this attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen
                    readers to read out the alt text to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Something has gone wrong causing the image to not display. For example, try deliberately changing
                    the path inside your <span class="text-background">src</span> attribute to make it incorrect. If you
                    save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:<br><br>
                    <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9349/alt-text-example.png" alt="Test image">
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The key words about alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader
                with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text
                of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The
                Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."<br><br>Try coming up with some better alt text for
                your image now.

        <section class="main-section" id="Marking_up_text">
            <header>Marking up text</header>
            <p>
                This section will cover some of the basic HTML elements you'll use for marking up text.
            </p>

            <h3>Headings</h3>
            <p>
                Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings —
                of your content. In the same way that a book has a main title, chapter titles and subtitles, an HTML
                document can too. HTML contains six heading levels, <span class="text-background">&#60;h1></span>–<span
                    class="text-background">&#60;h6></span> although you'll commonly only use 3–4 at most:
            </p>
            <code>
                &#60;h1>My main title&#60;/h1><br>
                &#60;h2>My top level heading&#60;/h2><br>
                &#60;h3>My subheading&#60;/h3><br>
                &#60;h4>My sub-subheading&#60;/h4>
            </code>
            <p>
                Now try adding a suitable title to your HTML page just above your <span
                    class="text-background">&#60;img></span> element
            </p>

            <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
            <p>
                As explained above, <span class="text-background">&#60;p></span> elements are for containing paragraphs
                of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:
            </p>
            <code>&#60;p>This is a single paragraph&#60;/p></code>
            <p>
                Add your sample text (you should have it from <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_should_your_web_site_be_like"
                    target="_blank">What should your website look like?</a>) into one or a few paragraphs, placed
                directly below your <span class="text-background">&#60;img></span> element.
            </p>

            <h3>Lists</h3>
            <p>
                A lot of the web's content is lists, and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always
                consist of at least two elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Unordered lists</b> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, like a shopping
                    list. These are wrapped in a <span class="text-background">&#60;ul></span> element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Ordered lists</b> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, like a recipe. These
                    are wrapped in an <span class="text-background">&#60;ol></span> element.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Each item inside the lists is put inside an <span class="text-background">&#60;li></span> (list item)
                element.<br><br>For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a
                list:
            </p>
            <code>
                &#60;p>At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders working together
                ... &#60;/p>
            </code>
            <p>We could modify the markup to this:</p>
            <code>
                &#60;p>At Mozilla, we’re a global community of&#60;/p><br><br>
                &#60;ul><br>
                &nbsp; &#60;li>technologists&#60;/li><br>
                &nbsp; &#60;li>thinkers&#60;/li><br>
                &nbsp; &#60;li>builders&#60;/li><br>
                &#60;/ul><br><br>
                &#60;p>working together ... &#60;/p>
            </code>

                Try adding an ordered or unordered list to your example page.

        <section class="main-section" id="Links">
            <header>Links</header>
            <p>
                Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple
                element — <span class="text-background">&#60;a></span> — the "a" being short for "anchor". To make text
                within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wrap the text in an <span class="text-background">&#60;a></span> element, like so:
                    <code>
                        &#60;a>Mozilla Manifesto&#60;/a>
                    </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Give the <span class="text-background">&#60;a></span> element an <span
                        class="text-background">href</span> attribute, like so:
                    <code>
                        &#60;a href="">Mozilla Manifesto&#60;/a>
                    </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to:
                    <code>&#60;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto&#60;/a>
                    </code>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                You might get unexpected results if you omit the <span class="text-background">https://</span> or <span
                    class="text-background">http://</span> part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web
                address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.
            </p>
            <code class="note">
                <span class="text-background">href</span> might appear like a rather obscure choice for an attribute
                name at first. If you are having trouble remembering it, remember that it stands for hypertext
                reference.
            </code>
