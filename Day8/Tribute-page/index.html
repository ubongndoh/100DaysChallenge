            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Nelson Mandela's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> <strong>1914</strong> - born in cape town, South Africa.</li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> 
                    <strong>1938</strong> -Mr. Mandela is admitted to the University of Fort Hare,
                    a black institution.Two years later he will be expelled for leading a student protest.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> 
                    <strong>1944</strong> -Mr. Mandela marries Evelyn Ntoko Mase. The couple will
                    have four children, but Mr. Mandela’s political activities will put a strain on
                    the relationship. The couple will divorce in 1958.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> 
                    <strong>1944</strong> - Mr. Mandela and other activists form the African National Congress Youth
                    League after becoming disenchanted with the cautious approach of the older
                    members of the A.N.C. The league’s formation marks the shift of the congress
                    to a mass movement. But its manifesto, so charged with pan-African nationalism,
                    offends some non-black sympathizers.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> 
                    <strong>1948</strong> - The National Party takes power in South Africa and sets out
                    to construct apartheid, a system of strict racial segregation and white domination.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>

                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> 
                    <strong>1956</strong> - Mr. Mandela is arrested at his home and charged with treason,
                    along with 155 others who called for a nonracial state in South Africa.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> 
                    <strong>1958</strong> - In the midst of Mr. Mandela’s trial on treason charges, he marries
                    Nomzamo Winifred Madikizela, 16 years his junior. The tumultuous union will produce two daughters
                    and a
                    national drama of forced separation, devotion, remorse and acrimony.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> 
                    <strong>1960</strong> - The police fire on a demonstration in Sharpeville, killing 69 people
                    and wounding 181. After the shooting, the South African government bans black political groups
                    and gatherings, and arrests thousands. The A.N.C. is among the banned groups. Its members go
                    underground
                    and begin planning a campaign of direct attacks on the apartheid government.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> 
                    <strong>1961</strong> -Mr. Mandela and his co-defendants are acquitted of treason. Fearing he
                    will be arrested again, Mr. Mandela goes underground.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> 
                    <strong>1962</strong> - Mr. Mandela is arrested after returning to South Africa from a trip abroad.
                    At the time of his arrest, he had been living underground for 17 months. He is convicted of leaving
                    the country illegally and incitement to strike, and is sentenced to five years in prison.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> <strong>1964</strong> - Mr. Mandela and seven others are convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
                    Mr. Mandela is sent to Robben Island prison, seven miles off the coast of Cape Town. He will spend
                    the next 18 years there.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> 
                    <strong>1976</strong> - Tens of thousands of students take to the streets of Soweto to oppose the
                    use of Afrikaans as the language of instruction in black schools. The police fire on the protesters,
                    setting off months of violence that will leave more than 570 people dead. The uprising is considered
                    a turning point in the history of black resistance to apartheid.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> 
                    <strong>1982</strong> - Mr. Mandela and four other A.N.C. leaders are transferred from Robben Island
                    to Pollsmoor Prison in the suburbs of Cape Town. While many believe the move is intended to lessen
                    the influence of the famous prisoners, government officials later say they wanted a way to open a
                    discreet line of communication with the men.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> <strong>1985</strong> - Kobie Coetsee, South Africa’s minister of justice, police and prisons,
                    visits Mr. Mandela, who is in a hospital undergoing surgery for an enlarged prostate. Secret
                    negotiations between Mr. Mandela and the government will continue for years without the public’s
                    knowledge. During this time, Mr. Mandela will be taken on secret excursions outside the prison walls
                    so he can reconnect with the world, after losing touch with it over decades as a prisoner.
                </li> 
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> <strong>1986</strong> - The government declares a nationwide state of emergency, granting itself
                    sweeping powers, including authorization for the police to use force against protesters and to
                    impose curfews. The decree bans the promotion of unlawful strikes, boycotts and protests and puts
                    tight restrictions on the press. More than 1,000 activists are detained.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> <strong>1989</strong>- Mr. Mandela meets informally with Mr. Botha at the presidential office in
                    Cape Town. It is the first publicly acknowledged meeting between Mr. Mandela and a government
                    official outside prison, and leads to speculation that he will soon be released.
                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> <strong>1990</strong>- Mr. Mandela, now 71, is freed without conditions, ending 27 and a half years
                    of imprisonment. For Mr. de Klerk, enlisting Mr. Mandela in negotiations over a new constitution
                    seems to be the surest way to achieve his stated goal: to end political domination by the white
                    minority without replacing it with domination by the black majority.

                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> <strong>1993</strong>- Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk share the Nobel Peace Prize. The two men accept
                    the award with the strained grace that has characterized their relationship, and Mr. Mandela
                    declines to repeat his much-quoted assessment of Mr. de Klerk as a man of integrity.

                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> <strong>1994</strong>-Mr. Mandela is sworn in as president of South Africa, making a speech of
                    shared patriotism that summons South Africans’ communal exhilaration in their land and their relief
                    at being freed from the world’s disapproval.

                </li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> <strong>2013</strong>-The government announces that Mr. Mandela has died, leaving the nation without
                    its moral center at a time of growing dissatisfaction with the country’s leaders.
                    “Our nation has lost its greatest son,” President Jacob Zuma said in a televised address late
                    Thursday night, adding that Mr. Mandela had died at 8:50 p.m. local time.
